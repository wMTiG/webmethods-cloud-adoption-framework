### **Use Case Description**

A retail company's inventory management system leverages webMethods iPaaS as an API-led integration platform to connect cloud-hosted applications, such as their Inventory Management Application (IMA), with an on-premise inventory database and external supplier systems. The architecture is designed to manage inventory levels in real-time, automate restocking processes, and optimize supplier coordination using cloud messaging and hybrid connectivity.



### **High-Level Architecture Overview**



- **Inventory Database (On-Premise)**: This core repository stores all inventory-related data, including stock levels, product information, and pricing. It resides securely within the companyâ€™s on-premise infrastructure.

- **On-Premise Integration Server**: Acts as a secure gateway that facilitates communication between the on-premise database and cloud-based systems. This server uses a hybrid connectivity solution to ensure secure data transfer between cloud and on-premise environments.

- **webMethods.io API Gateway**: Mediates API calls from the Inventory Management Application (IMA), handling actions such as authentication, request routing, and throttling.

- **webMethods.io Integration Platform (iPaaS)**: Manages business logic, request transformation, and enrichment with channel information, preparing requests for secure on-premise communication and interaction with external systems.

- **Inventory Management Application (IMA)**: A cloud-hosted application that interfaces with the inventory database to manage stock levels, update product information, and process orders. It integrates seamlessly with webMethods iPaaS for data exchange and is accessible by company staff.

- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Establishes a secure connection from webMethods.io in the cloud to on-premise systems via a Hybrid Connector, facilitating secure data exchanges.

- **On-Premise MSR (Material Stock Repository)**: Manages data mapping to adapter formats and orchestrates database operations, acting as a secure gateway for interactions with the on-premise inventory database.

- **Supplier Management System (SMS)**: A system integrated with the webMethods iPaaS platform to manage interactions with multiple suppliers, checking item availability, pricing, and delivery options for restocking purposes.

- **External Supplier Systems**: Systems managed by various suppliers that provide inventory data, pricing, and delivery information in response to restocking requests.

  ### **Low-Level Design Details**

  1. **Automated Restocking and Supplier Coordination Flow**:
     1. The Inventory Management Application (IMA) detects low stock levels and sends a restocking request to the webMethods.io API Gateway.
     2. The API Gateway authenticates the request using secure API keys stored in a vault.
     3. The integration workflow enriches the request with additional data, such as channel information and necessary transformations.
     4. The enriched request is published to a **cloud messaging topic** to initiate parallel supplier checks.
     5. **Parallel Supplier Availability Check**:
        - The Supplier Management System (SMS) subscribes to the cloud messaging topic and forwards the request to multiple external supplier systems.
        - Each supplier responds with stock availability, pricing, delivery times, and quality ratings.
     6. **Response Aggregation**:
        - The SMS aggregates supplier responses in real-time, collecting data on availability, cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability.
     7. **Decision-Making**:
        - A set of business rules or an AI model processes the aggregated data to select the best supplier based on criteria such as proximity, cost, quality, and delivery time.
     8. The Order Management System (OMS) places an order with the selected supplier via a cloud messaging topic, ensuring all relevant systems are updated.
     9. IMS updates inventory records to reflect the incoming stock.
     10. The Financial System (FS) processes payment and updates financial records.
     11. The supplier confirms the order, and shipping details are published back to the cloud messaging topic, updating all relevant systems.
     12. Notifications are sent to inventory managers about the new order placement and expected delivery.
  2. **API Endpoint Definitions**:
     - **Inventory Management Application (IMA) API Definitions**:
       - **Read GET (Query Stock Levels)**: An API endpoint `/gateway/inventory/{productName}/stockLevel` for retrieving current stock levels.
       - **Read GET (Get Product Details)**: An API endpoint `/gateway/inventory/v1/product?name={productName}` for getting product details.
       - **Create POST (Add New Product)**: An endpoint `/gateway/inventory/v1/product` for adding new product details to the database.
       - **Update PUT (Update Product Details)**: An endpoint `/gateway/inventory/v1/product` for updating stock quantities.
       - **Update PATCH (Adjust Stock Levels)**: An endpoint `/gateway/inventory/v1/product/{productName}/updateStock` for updating stock quantities.
       - **Delete DELETE (Remove Product)**: An endpoint `/gateway/inventory/v1/product` for removing a product record.
     - **Material Stock Repository (MSR) API Definitions**:
       - **Check Stock GET**: An API endpoint `/msr/checkStock?productId={productId}` for checking current stock levels in the on-premise inventory database.
       - **Update Stock POST**: An API endpoint `/msr/updateStock` for updating stock levels based on incoming orders or restocking.
       - **Query Product Details GET**: An API endpoint `/msr/queryProduct?productId={productId}` for retrieving detailed product information from the on-premise database.
